# ShareModal-Project
A share modal project using JavaScript typically involves creating a modal window that allows users to easily share content from your website or application on various social media platforms.
Here's a basic outline of what such a project might entail:

# 1: HTML Structure:-
-> You'll need a button or link that triggers the modal window.
-> Inside the modal, include options for sharing on different platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), as well as an option to email the content.
-> Each option should have a corresponding icon and label.

# 2: CSS Styling:-
-> Style the modal window to appear centered on the screen, with a backdrop that darkens the rest of the page to focus attention on the modal.
-> Design the buttons and icons for sharing options to be visually appealing and intuitive.

# 3: JavaScript Functionality:-
-> Write JavaScript code to handle the opening and closing of the modal when the share button/link is clicked.
-> Implement functionality for sharing content on various platforms:
-> For social media platforms, you'll typically use their respective APIs or URL schemes to open share dialogs.
